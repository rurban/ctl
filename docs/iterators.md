# iterators - CTL - C Container Template library

Defined automatically for all containers, CTL suffix **_it**.

## SYNOPSIS

    #define POD
    #define T int
    #include <ctl/list.h>

    list_int a = list_int_init();
    // ...
    list_int_it first = list_digi_begin(&a);
    long i1 = rand() % a.size;
    list_int_it_advance(&first, i1);
    printf("first: [%ld, ", list_int_it_distance(list_digi_begin(&a), &first);

    list_int_it last = list_digi_end(&a);
    long i2 = i1 + (rand() % (a.size + i1));
    list_int_it_advance(&last, -i2);
    printf("%ld)\n", list_int_it_distance(list_digi_begin(&a), &last);

    printf("values: (%d, %d)\n", *first.ref. *last.ref);

    // restrict first to last (optional)
    list_int_it_range(&first, &last);

    some_method_range(first, last);


## DESCRIPTION

Iterators hold state for all containers, i.e. the container, the current
position, the end position and additional private fields per container to
support its methods.

Some iterators advance on linked nodes (_"B iters"_), some others on value
refs (_"T iters"_). The deque additionally holds the `index`, the unordered_set
the `next` and `buckets` pointer.

We don't support **output iterators**, like `back_inserter` or `inserter` yet.
They are currently only defined for `transform_range` and `transform_it_range`,
which are not enabled yet, and problematic for `set`.

Also we don't support `reverse_iterator` via `I prev` yet.

## Iterators

    I begin (A* self)

Constructs an iterator to the begin.

    I end (A* self)

Constructs an iterator to the end.

    int done (I* iter)

returns 1 if the iterator reached its end. With ranges this might not be the container end.

    I* next (I* iter)

Advances the iterator by 1 forwards. There's no prev yet.

    I* advance (I* iter, long i)

All our variants accepts negative `i` to move back. The return value may be ignored.

    long distance (I* first, I* last)

When first is not before last, list returns -1, the other containers wrap around and
return negative numbers.

    range (I* first, I* last)

range sets the first and last end positions. For `unordered_set` the API
is still the old `(A* container, B* begin, B* end)`, but we don't support
algorithm iterators on ranges, as they make no sense for unordered containers.

    T* ref (I* pos)

returns the value reference.

# Performance

Compared to the old ctl, our iterators are about twice as fast, just our
`unordered_set` iterator is slower.

Compared to the STL, `unordered_set` is twice as slow, our `set` is O(1),
whilst the STL set iterator is logarithmic, the rest is as fast as in the STL.

The `unordered_set` iterator is still in work.
