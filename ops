It should be implementation-specific at all.\n\nclang++ and libc++ is the default CXX on macOS and FreeBSD.\nMSVC will be a different beast, and ICC had traditionally the most libc++ bugs.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"67acf4ce3a9e0b675b41dc633e984435404c2f17"},"timestamp":1610445209,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxOTQ5NzY5ODA="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"67acf4ce3a9e0b675b41dc633e984435404c2f17"},"timestamp":1610475275,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE5NzI3NDg4Ng=="},"status":2}]}
